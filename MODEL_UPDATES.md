## Migration Considerations

The new models are designed to be backward compatible where possible, but existing data may need migration for full feature utilization. The register API maintains backward compatibility while supporting new comprehensive features.

## Next Steps

1. Update frontend forms to support new comprehensive fields

3. Implement admin dashboards for user management
4. Add file upload functionality for documents and images
5. Implement email and SMS verification workflows
6. Create analytics dashboards for performance tracking
